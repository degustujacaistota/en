It started with planning a schedule of restaurants to visit on our July mini fine dining tour of Krakow. 
Kamila and Cezary (@finediningpl) recommended @cheznicholasresto to us but as the competition was strong we couldn't decide.
 When I was about to book the restaurants I had a dream about a beautiful dark blue room with a painting of a golden pheasant.
  When I noticed in the story on Instagram,
  that this is exactly what Chef Nichola's Bistro looks like, of course, I made a reservation. 
    Thus began our addiction to Chez Nicholas restaurant. 
  I won't even try to hide that we fell in love with the place and the Chef himself.
As I write this we are already after three brilliant dinners at Chef Nicholas and we are about to have another one.

Chef of Chez Nicholas is really called Yinliang Zhoulezi LU, and Nicholas is his nickname.
He is from China and graduated from the renowned French culinary school Ferrandi in Paris (@ferrandiparis),
 after which he gained experience in several restaurants in France including those with @michelinguide stars.
His charming, little bistro is absolutely unique. 
Tables brought from France, framed old French newspapers hang on the walls, and of course,
 a painting of a beautiful golden pheasant which Chef Nicholas asked to be painted especially for his boutique French restaurant,
  as a Chinese accent. 
Meals here are eaten with silver cutlery from the 18th and 19th centuries on paper tablecloths.

The restaurant's menu is mainly French, but also includes Chinese recipes. 
Everything here is honest and authentic from the beginning to the end. 
The chef himself takes care of selecting the best products from 
markets and suppliers so that at Chez Nicholas we can eat fresh products of the highest quality.
  The menu changes every day depending on the product's availability.

### Degustation:

#### *Steamed buns / butter / Olive Oil*

Instead of the traditional bread before our meal, we got steamed buns in a variety of flavors.
 The Chef served them again as soon as they ran out, which we really liked, 
 because they were perfect for finishing the sauces. The sauces at Chef Nicholas are divine, it is a sin to leave them on a plate.
The homemade buns were made using alkaline water, Julienas Beaujolais village red wine (Gamay Grape), spinach, and sorrel.
For the buns we got Isigny Butter AOP from Normandy with black summer truffle Tuber Aestivum from Croatia and Taggiasche olives and Espelette peppers.
Also there was an excellent olive oil from AOP Les Vallées de Baux de Provence. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

Next to the bowls lies a flat, oval plate on which are two steamed buns, cut into four pieces. 
One is white, the other red. On the same plate, next to the buns lies a bowl of olive oil. 
In the last bowl is a small silver spoon. In the background you can see navy blue walls and a Painting depicting a golden pheasant."

Tartare of tuna belly part with homemade Ponzu, grapefruit, confit lemon zest, Limoncello and lemon juice, and yuzu,
ginger confit in sake, mirin and Japanese whiskey.
On top, portulaca leaves as a salad. A sensational tartare that gets the Happy Eggplant Badge from us. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Beef Tartare Tokyo Style*

We ate the beef tartare at Chez Nicholas in two renditions and both deserved the Order of the Happy Eggplant.

 The first was a super surprise as we got a double portion of tartare (a la carte). For lovers of this dish, it's hard to find something better.
Perfect, finely chopped beef with a sabayon of light mayo with Japanese chili powder, grapefruit, yuzu, 
crispy shiitake mushrooms (from Mr. Grela from Lublin) with mizuna cabbage, 
Japanese whiskey, and red wine glaze with anise, cinnamon, and black fruit purée. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

The second was also finely chopped, made with Black Angus beef and combined with green zebra tomato tartare.

#### *Spider Crab from Roscoff*


The Chef loves to serve this particular crab steamed and with different accompaniments. 
It is served in the shell of this particular crab, which looks very impressive.
As with the tartare, both crabs were sensational and got orders from us.
The Chef likes to serve this particular crab steamed and with different toppings. 

In the first version, we got crab steamed and deboned,
 with black garlic mayonnaise and a collection of local bio veggies in salad including a steamed zucchini flower. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Fine de claire oysters*

Fine de Claire oysters from Oléron, France.  I'm not a fan of oysters, but these were outstanding.
 Steamed in the oven served with rice Vermicelli, seasoned with salty sabayon with Garlic trilogy and oyster sauce. Topped with Green Zebra tomato tartare.
   We award the Order of the Happy Eggplant for these wonderfully delicious oysters.  _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Wonton*

Wonton with Black Tiger shrimp and lobster. Accompanied with a fantastic bisque. The bisque is mind-blowing. Chef Nicholas makes it with 11 different seafood and fish. This version had curry paste and coconut milk added. Steamed golden beans on the top. 
I cannot do otherwise like award another Order of the Happy Eggplant to the wonderful Wonton. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

#### *Gratin with forest mushrooms*

Gratin with different mushrooms: chanterelles, boletus, boletus, boletus, canine, king oyster mushroom, with champagne béchamel,
 foie gras, anchovy paste, rum brioche and Gruyère cheese.
I still remember the beautiful aroma, the creamy interior, and the harmony of mushroom and cheese flavors.
 The perfect autumn dish, which receives from us the Order of the Happy Eggplant. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

The perfect risotto with prawns and scallop sautéed with chanterelle mushrooms, roasted zucchini flower, bisque (that divine bisque),

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Risotto with langoustine*

Oven-roasted langoustine from France and the best bisque.
 The whole thing twisted up with curry, Espelette peppers, white wine and cognac.
  Delicate langoustine and a crisp, perfectly prepared risotto. The Eggplant Order for risotto flies again. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Duck breast*

Duck breast marinated in Ponzu and flambéed with herb vodka. As a completion: French purée with olive oil, baked spaghetti beans, 
king oyster mushroom and chanterelles from Lublin,
 which were roasted in the oven with olive oil and duck fat. The Burek was also an interesting element of this dish. 
  A crispy quasi-pancake with cheese in the middle. The whole dish was brought together beautifully by the Albufera sauce.
   This sauce was created by Marie-Antoine Carême in honor of Napoleon's general, Louis-Gabriel Suchet, Duke of D'Albufera da Valencia. 
Chef Nicholas made it with chicken, duck, goose, foie gras and crème fraîche from Deux-Sèvres. 
The spiciness of the dish was added by Chef's own dried Chili brought from Lecce, Italy.
 A perfect duck! And of course, the Order of the Happy Eggplant. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Goose leg*

A similar combination as in the dish above. In this version, we got a confit leg of goose with lime, kaffir, and tamarind. 
It is worth mentioning that for the main course we received a beautiful, original Laguiole knife.
 A wonderful dish and a wonderful rating and the Happy Eggplant Order. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

#### *The Three Treasures Of The Land*

This is another original Chinese dish that Chef Nicholas learned from his mother. 
The fresh peppers and eggplants for this dish Chef Nicholas brought by himself from a trip to Greece. 
The peppers, eggplant, and potatoes were fried in a light tempura sweet and sour sauce with caramelized garlic flakes and rice vinegar aged for 3 years. A perfect, spicy, and tasty dish. The eggplant was incredibly tender and full of flavor. 
 One would like to eat this dish every day. I miss it already and naturally award the Order of the Happy Eggplant. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

#### *Cherries à la Jubilée*

I'm speechless. You have to taste it for yourself. Warm, ripe cherries in salted caramel, with Isigny Butter AOP from Normandy, with caramelized pistachios and cherry liqueur. 
 This dessert was created for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee on June 20, 1887.

We ate this best dessert in the world in the aroma of rose water from Provence, with beautiful opera music and rose petals all around us.
Magical! If I could I would give a hundred eggplant orders. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

#### *Petit four*

Cannelé de Bordeaux with Vermuth wine as [Petit four]. I love Cannelé, these wonderfully buttery and soft sweets
 are the perfect finale to a French tasting with a Chinese twist. 
 They were made exactly as they should be. I adore them and of course, they get the Order of the Happy Eggplant. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

### Summary:

Each visit to Chez Nicholas restaurant has been unique and magical.
 It is [fine dining] at the highest level with luxurious products of excellent quality straight from France and beyond. 
 Chef's talent, skill and diligence can be seen at every step.
Chef Nicholas himself served every dish and passionately told us about every detail we could think of.
 We literally could have talked to him like that for hours. 

As you can see there was not a dish that we did not like. We have enjoyed the most: all the tartares, 
Bisque, Three Treasures of the Land, foie gras, gratin, duck, goose and those cherries... ah! Perfection.
For these sensational dishes, for the commitment, talent and gigantic work of the Chef and his crew we wholeheartedly award the Happy Eggplant Badge and send huge thanks. See you soon.

Finally, an important note, if you want to go for this boutique French experience at Chez Nicholas take cash with you,
 because there is no card payment, but there is an ATM right next to the restaurant.

At the end we got a surprise from Chef Nicholas,
 when we visited his bistro with Jolka (@foodie_dreamka) and Kamil (@flairhousemk). 
 It was a lovely evening with great company and brilliant food.
