---
The Degustująca Istota(Degustating Being) walks around with other Beings to the restaurants.
Eats, takes pictures and then describes what she tasted.
Tries not to hurt anyone with her judgment.
Is aware that the restaurant team in often puts a lot of work and heart into what they do.
The Degustująca Istota appreciates this work very much
and at the same time wants to be helpful for those who are looking for good restaurant recommendations.
Do not expect beautiful sentences and correct grammar. This is not her strong site in any language.
 As a profession I am Quality Assurance Engineer in the IT. I live in Silesia region in Poland.
 I am enthusiast of vegetable cuisine, but I am not vegetarian. I especially love the Fine dining.

I do not write sponsored content. I(or my close ones) chooses what and where to eat and to test and we pay for ourselves.

Why am I writing this blog? Because I have a poor memory, I love delicious food and want to be able to remember what and
where I ate, how delicious it was or not ;) By the publicizing my opinion about the restaurant/dish,
I would like to be useful to those who are looking for restaurant recommendations.
This is also how I want to appreciate talented Chefs.
