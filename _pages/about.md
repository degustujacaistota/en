The Degustująca Istota (Degustating Being) walks around with other Beings to the restaurants.
Eats, takes pictures and describes what she tasted.

 As a profession I am Quality Assurance Engineer in the IT. I live in Silesia region in Poland.
 I am enthusiast of vegetable cuisine, but I am not vegetarian. I especially admire the Fine Dining and a molecular cuisine.

### Why Eggplant?

On the one hand, because I consider it as one of the less appreciated vegetables although it has amazing potential.
In many restaurants I met with a complete misunderstanding of its taste and bad preparation. 
So it became a symbol of my blog, as a vegetable well showing the chef's abilities.

On the other hand, I think the tasting eggplant is funny.And I wanted to add a bit of humor so that the blog in which
I write mostly about luxurious and elegant dinners in the Fine Dining style was not too pretentious and stiff.
After all, even eating in a restaurant with 
Michelin Guide stars we want to eat deliciously and have fun, instead of sitting tense, like on an exam.

### Why am I writing this blog? 

1. For myself: <br/>
Because I have a poor memory. I love delicious food and want to be able to remember
 what and where I ate, how delicious it was or not;) and which Chef prepared these dishes.
 
2. For people who are looking for good cuisine: <br/>
By the publicizing my opinion about the restaurant/dish,
I would like to be useful to those who are looking for restaurant recommendations, 
or inspiration for their own culinary creations.

3. For chefs and restaurants:  <br/>
Sometimes both restaurants and chefs, especially in fine dining restaurants, but not only, ask for feedback.
I try to make my comments as  substantial as I can and  not emotional. Unfortunately, it comes out differently.
 And if anyone is offended by my words, I'm sorry in advance. 
This was not my intention. I realize how much effort and commitment work in a restaurant requires.

4. Because it's my hobby: <br/>
I don't write sponsored content. 
I do not earn by my blog, it is only my hobby for which I devote a large part of my home budget ;)
